### Flutter Conferences

All Flutter COnferences in one place! This code showcases building a webapp which serves html using `mustache` templating engine and `scss`. It uses the shelf package to serve files using Pipeline() and Cascade() classes using Middlewares.

### My Pubdev

A personalized clone of pubdev which displays a list of packages fetched from backend. This was built using the `webdev` package and uses dart to manipulate the DOM once packages are fetched from the server.

### Pub API

this project mimics the pub api for fetching packages, it implements appropriate routes using `shelf_router` package and responds with JSON data from a file using the hosted pub repository specification.

**API Endpoints**

| Route                | Description       | Method |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| /api/                | Test endpoint     | GET    |
| /api/packages/       | Get all packages  | GET    |
| /api/package/        | Add a new package | POST   |
| /api/package/< name> | Get a package     | GET    |
| /api/package/< name> | Delete a package  | DELETE |

### Checklist
